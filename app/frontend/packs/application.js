// If you have javascript that *must* execute before the page has finished loading,
// create a separate 'boot.js' pack in the frontend/packs directory and import any
// required files in that. Also remember to add a separate pack_tag entry with:
// <%= javascript_pack_tag "boot", "data-turbolinks-track": "reload" %>

// To reference this file, add <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %> to the appropriate

//
//   import HelloController from "../stimulus/controllers/hello_controller"
//   application.register("hello", HelloController)
//   import OtherController from "../stimulus/controllers/other_controller"
//   application.register("other", OtherController)
